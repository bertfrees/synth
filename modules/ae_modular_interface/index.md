# Interface for AE modular

Pair of modules for interfacing with a [AE
modular](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/) system.

My synth is electrically compatible with AE modular, but in order to
cross-patch between the two a conversion is needed from banana plug
cables to AEM's broadboard jumper wires. The interface consists of two
adapter modules, one in AE format and one in 3U format, that are
connected with a ribbon cable.

Some pictures of the AE module:
